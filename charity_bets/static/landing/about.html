    <h2>What?</h2>
    <p>
      betti is a social betting app with a philanthropic twist.
      It pairs the excitement of friendly betting and competition with all the goodness of charitable fundraising.
      Bets can be made about anything, anywhere, and at anytime, with all proceeds going toward
      a nonprofit organization of the winner’s choosing.  In addition, crowdsourcing allows friends,
      family, and even strangers to further fund users’ bets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why is this cool?  It allows friendly competition to have real
      stakes by providing users the opportunity to legally make public bets online.
      By gamifying the experience with statistics and data visualizations, betti incentivizes users
      to keep generating donations for organizations of their choosing.
    </p>

    <h2>Why?</h2>

    betti was built by four students of <a href="http://www.theironyard.com">The Iron Yard Coding Academy</a> in Durham,
    North Carolina. They all wanted to work on a project that was both fun and meaningful before
    marching off into their new lives. betti went live two weeks after it was born.  It was ridicolously fun, but incredibly challenging.
