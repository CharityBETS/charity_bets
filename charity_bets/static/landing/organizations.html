    <h2>Our Partner Organizations</h2>
    <p>
      We have been lucky enough to partner with and raise donations for some great organizations. In that process we have learned a lot more about why they are so important. We would like to take this opportunity to highlight those organizations so that you can learn more about them if you are interested.

        Meals on Wheels of Durham delivers a nutritious meal, a safety check and the smile that serve as a lifeline to seniors of limited mobility. This combination goes well beyond fighting the battle against the hunger that threatens one in six of America’s seniors – it provides the support and peace of mind that enable them to remain safely and securely in their own homes as they continue to age. Enabling seniors to stay in their own homes means they remain happier, extend their independence and can stay connected to the communities and surroundings that provide them comfort. The powerful side effect of this result is that it means seniors can stay out of expensive nursing facilities and hospitals.

        Avalo formed in response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Since then, we've responded to a variety of incidents, big and small, around the country and around the corner. We've worked on hoarding cases, hurricane responses, apartment fires and plenty more. We've also responded when no disaster is present at all through our outreach efforts to educate the community about the importance of having an emergency plan in place that includes pets. All of our work is made possible by generous donations of time and money from people like you.
